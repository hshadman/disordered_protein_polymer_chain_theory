# disordered_protein_polymer_chain_theory
in this project, i am attempting to use polymer physics quantities to describe and generate a map of the conformational landscape of intrinsically disordered proteins. This map shows what the range of conformations accessible to a protein is in terms of the polymer physics quantities of shape and size.
